## MY RESUME
This repo holds my resume in word and pdf formats.

I'm putting it up here so I can have a central place where
all updates to my resume/cv go to.  
But perhaps more importantly, I can point potential employers
here as well. 

I will update this readme in the near future with more
info from my resume, for those who might not want to go
through the task of downloading/opening the files.

Got any questions? Please, [create an issue](https://github.com/mekicha/my_cv/issues) and I will attend to them asap!

Want to help me improve my CV? Thank you and please [send a PR](https://github.com/mekicha/my_cv/pulls) :)

Thank you!
